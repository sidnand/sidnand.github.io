Dr. Siddharth Nand holds a Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of British Columbia, where his research focused on scalable Bayesian inference, distributed computation, and probabilistic modelling. His work spans the development of parallel inference algorithms, dimension-scalable sampling methods, and efficient optimization techniques for structured and sequential models. He is broadly interested in the intersection of statistical methodology, machine learning, and large-scale computational systems. He also enjoys dabbling in applied areas like quantitative finance and econometrics.
